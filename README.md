# Orthosis-movement-with-arduino

Project developed in Arduino to precisely and controlledly control an orthosis with a servo motor.

It regulates the usage cycles for each session, which can be controlled and modified by the personnel in charge of the device.

It provides detailed information about the exercise's current state thanks to the implementation of the liquid crystal display.

Developed on the premises of the Autonomous University of Chile as a demonstration for the students.

### Main Parts

- Arduino Uno
- TD-8120MG Servo Motor
- 16x2 I2C LCD Display
- Rotary Encoder
- 3D printed case
- Cables and M3 screws
